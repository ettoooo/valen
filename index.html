          <h2>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love</h2>
          <p class="letter">This is our third valentines together as a couple :D, and technically our fourth if we also count being    valentines in 2023… nonetheless, I couldn’t be more happier going into this year with you as my lover again. I hope to be your valentine, every valentine, for every year to come.

Through all of our ups and downs, every disappointment, and every joy, everything is all part of this giant journey called love. 
I’ve been feeling much happier also. Everyday all day, I am grateful and happy for all that I get to experience, and you’re the biggest part of it all. 
The biggest blessing I could’ve ever asked for, the greatest experience I could’ve ever received. 
I cannot wait to see what the future holds for us. 
You’ve taught me to be so observant of so many things, the sky, clouds, trees, flowers, and of course shadows hehehe. 
You’ve taught me how to find beauty in subtlety. 
Everything is inherently beautiful, I can believe that because I know you!!!
I’m thinkings Valentine’s Day shouldn’t be a special day. Everyday should be special. 
I love you more each day and the last. 
Ahaha also I’m sorry for being soooo paranoid so much hehehe, I’ll try to be less so. Sorry for annoying youuuuauauaua 🤭 
It’s a beautiful day today, when I’m writing this. The sun is shining brightly, birds are chirping, and the flowers are bloomin. 
Everything is awesome.
I would also like to thank you for helping me find my faith. I would like to add that I still do recite prayer everyday. ཨོཾ།
I am also very grateful for the opportunity I get to be able to grow while in this long distance relationship with you baby. I get to find myself, and grow much as a person, all while you’re here to witness it too. 
I am grateful for the opportunity of getting to watch you grow and morph into the person you are today. I look forward to being by your side as you keep growing, and I hope you are too!!!

It’s been no bed of roses. no pleasure cruise.
Lyrics from, “We Are the Champions” by Queen hehe.
Life with you is not about it all being a bed of roses, or seeing through rose tinted glasses. It’s about persevering through the hardships. And since we do keep persevering, I can’t help but be optimistic about everything. 
Hehe anywayyyy, I’m looking forward to watching a movie with you later tonight 🤭 
You’ll see this message after datttt!!

To my forever valentine, my bestest friend, Tshoki Peljore Toffy, I love you very much:))))

I enjoy talking to you so much, it’s so natural always, and so very fun every time we talk.
It’s only gotten easier and easier and easier.

Hehehe I can hear you breathing. 
You just said something in your sleep, something about “being enough” 🤔 
I feel kinda weird oooOOO zum bey. My nose still blocked hahaha but other than that pretty okayyy.
Hehehe I miss you so much, my lovely.
I love how much we are able to talk these days. I look forward to calling you, and going to sleep with you every single night. 
It’s honestly, da highlight of ma day, everyday. And it’ll always be the highlight. 
I wish we got to spend more time in person too, but I just tell myself each day we are apart, only means we’re getting closer to being together again:D
I so excitingggg to see what foods you’re gonna cook during your break hehehe. I’m also looking forward to being able to cook for you in the future. The datshi I made last time at home was pretty darn good, I think you’d love it too. 
Hearing your voice gives me so much joy. It breathes life into my veins. 
Your voice is the sweetest candy, and the most melodious tune.
It’s like a song only I can truly appreciate.
I was too tired and sick yesterday to tell you, but you sounded so beautiful when you were singing for me :D
You’re the bestest most wonderful girl ever!!!! </p>

      <h2>Feb 3</h2>

      <p>Is been a few days heheh
We just watched some Ryan higa music videos.
Such a fun conversation we had this entire night. You’re the best person I could’ve ever dreamt of being together with!!!
Hmmmmmmm I been thinkin about your question darchir girrrr, and I wanna write it down for you so you can always read it!
1. You’re so self confident, so sure of what you are and are capable of. It’s one of the many things I love about you. It’s always so admirable the way you say you can do something, it made me more confident in things I think I can achieve also.
2. So very self content you are. So sure of what you want, and what you deserve. Finding beauty in the everyday. The leaves, the sun, the animals, and the shadows… hehehe. I’ve come to be more wary of my surroundings too. I’ve always kinda been I think, but now I’m even more so, learning from you!!!
3. How caring you are, the love and care you exhume runs and flows deep, and far. The care not just for me, but your friends, your family, the work you do, and everything else. Everything you do and care about has elements of you within them, and that is one of the loveliest things ever.
Oh ma gaw how much I love your cute smile, the little sounds you make when we talk, your laugh. Every second with you is so special. 
When I close my eyes, I see your face. When I open them, I imagine you in front of me. 
You’re always with me, always and forever.
I love you, Tshoki!</p>
